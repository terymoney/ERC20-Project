BlackGirlCoin
Overview
BlackGirlCoin is an ERC-20 token built using Hardhat, Truffle, and OpenZeppelin smart contract libraries. This token is deployed to the Ethereum blockchain using the Alchemy API for interaction with the blockchain. It follows the ERC-20 standard for token implementation, enabling easy integration with other dApps and platforms.

Technologies Used
Hardhat: A development environment to compile, test, and deploy smart contracts.
Truffle: A smart contract development framework to deploy contracts and manage migration scripts.
OpenZeppelin: A library of secure and community-vetted smart contracts, specifically used for creating the ERC-20 token.
Alchemy: A blockchain infrastructure provider used to connect to the Ethereum network.
Solidity: The programming language used to write the smart contract.
Features
ERC-20 compliant token with standard functions like transfer(), approve(), allowance(), etc.
Mint and transfer functionality to allow users to send and receive tokens.
Deployment through Hardhat and connected to the Ethereum network using Alchemy.
